    "# What is Flask Framework :-\n",
    "# Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build lightweight web applications \n",
    "# quickly and easily with Flask Libraries. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, leader of \n",
    "# the International Group of Python Enthusiasts(POCCO). It is basically based on the WSGI \n",
    "# toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Flask:-\n",
    "# 1. Flask is a lightweight backend framework with minimal dependencies.\n",
    "# 2. Flask is easy to learn because its simple and intuitive API makes it easy to learn and use for beginners.\n",
    "# 3. Flask is a flexible Framework because it allows you to customize and extend the framework to suit your needs easily.\n",
    "# 4. Flask can be used with any database like:- SQL and NoSQL and with any Frontend Technology such as React or Angular.\n",
    "# 5. Flask is great for small to medium projects that do not require the complexity of a large framework."
